# Disease Prediction Using Attention Mechanism And Severity Mapping 

—The combination of AI with healthcare makes the
 prediction of illnesses from given symptoms much more sig
nificant. This study proposes a DNN model that incorporates
 attention mechanisms along with embedding symptoms, graph
 attributes of symptomatic co-occurrence, and structured one-hot
 encoding symptoms in order to efficiently perform diagnostic
 classification. The more intricate inter-symptom cluster relation
ships are captured by the integration of semantic, relational,
 and categorical dimensions. Also model generalization and
 over fitting prevention are enhanced by strategic regularization
 performed with Dropout, Batch Normalization, and Early Stop
ping. The model developed using the Disease and Symptoms
 dataset and deep neural network, achieved an impressive test
 accuracy of 99.32%. The explain ability of the Multiplexed
 Attention model using SHAP value decomposition and Attention
 × Severity heat-maps outlines key symptoms relevant to each
 disease classification. As demonstrated in the proposed system,
 deep learning combined with multi-modal feature fusion can set
 new benchmarks in a clinical decision support system’s precision
 and explain ability.
